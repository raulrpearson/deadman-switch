Sometimes people die. That is very sad. But it would be even more sad if people died and then you could not get all their money. That is the problem we solve. To make Accounts on Starknet better, we introduce the Dead Man's Switch. You die, but other people get your money!
# How it works

It's very simple.

1. Set an heir and a time of delay
2. Die
3. Don't touch your account for a long time*
4. After the long time is up, your heir is eligible to access the account

*You can't do this anyway on the account of you being dead but just to be clear :-)
